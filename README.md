# MongoDB-Implementing-Enrollment

Objective: 

The primary goal is to develop a Python application using MongoEngine to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on MongoDB collections, ensuring the enforcement of business rules.

Procedure:

- Define the structure of collections such as departments, courses, students, and enrollments, incorporating attributes and uniqueness constraints.
  
- Use MongoDB validators to enforce schema rules and constraints directly within the database.

- Implement business rules in Python, such as preventing overlapping course sections within the same building and room during the same semester.

- Develop a console-based application allowing users to manage database records, including adding, listing, and deleting entries.

Key Components: 

- Understanding MongoDB's document-oriented structure and the concept of collections.

- Enforcing constraints using MongoDB validators and unique indexes.

- Implementing complex rules in Python to ensure data integrity and adherence to specified conditions.

- Utilizing Python try/except blocks to capture and handle data input violations, providing user-friendly error messages.

Tools Required:

- MongoDB Atlas: For hosting the database.

- MongoDB Validators: To define and enforce schema and data constraints.

- PyCharm: For Python development and MongoDB connectivity.

- Moon Modeler: For visual database modeling and planning.

This project provides hands-on experience with MongoDB validators, laying the groundwork for more complex database-driven applications. It emphasizes understanding database fundamentals, implementing business rules, and ensuring data integrity through effective error handling and user interaction.
